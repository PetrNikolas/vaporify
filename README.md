## Quick start

* Clone the repo.
* Run `vapor build` and `vapor run`.

## Build & Run

You can use the toolbox to build and run your Vapor app.

```bash
vapor build
vapor run
```

We recommend building and running through Xcode if you have a Mac. It's a bit faster and you can set breakpoints! Just use `vapor xcode` to generate an Xcode project.

## Deployment

Deploying your project to Vapor Cloud is simple, it's built right into the Vapor Toolbox. Just run this command from within the root directory of your project.

```bash
vapor cloud deploy
```
