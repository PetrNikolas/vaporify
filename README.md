# Vaporify

Simple starter kit for web applications in Swift and Vapor!

* Version: v0.0.1

## Table of Contents

* [Quick Start](#quick-start)
* [Build for production](#build-&-run)

## Quick start

* Clone the repo.
* Run `vapor build` and `vapor run`.

## Build & Run

You can use the toolbox to build and run your Vapor app.

```bash
vapor build
vapor run
```

We recommend building and running through Xcode if you have a Mac. It's a bit faster and you can set breakpoints! Just use `vapor xcode` to generate an Xcode project.

## Troubleshooting

If you are experiencing problems with SPM, sometimes cleaning your project can help.

```bash
vapor clean
```
